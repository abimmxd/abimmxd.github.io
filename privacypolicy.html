		<p>We have written this data protection declaration (version 23.10.2020-121781400) to explain to you, in accordance
			with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national laws, which
			personal data (data for short) we as the person responsible - and that of Processors commissioned by us (e.g.

			policy then you may not access the Service.</p>
		<p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
		<p>Data protection declarations usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this data
			protection declaration is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as
			possible. As far as transparency is beneficial, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links
			to further information are provided and graphics are used. We are informing in clear and simple language that we
			only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This
			is certainly not possible if you make as brief, unclear and legal-technical statements as possible, as they are
			often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations
			interesting and informative and maybe there is one or the other piece of information that you were not familiar
			with.
			If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the
			imprint, to follow the links provided and to look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course
			also find our contact details in the legal notice</p>
		<p>Area of application
			This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal
			data processed by companies commissioned by us (contract processors). By personal data, we mean information within
			the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing
			of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The
			scope of this data protection declaration includes:
			all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate
			Social media appearances and email communication
			mobile apps for smartphones and other devices
			In short: The data protection declaration applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured
			manner in the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these
			channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
		<p>You agree not to disclose your account information to any third party. You must notify Discord upon becoming
			aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
		<p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p>
		<p>In the following data protection declaration we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles
			and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process
			personal data.
			As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
			of April 27, 2016. You can of course access this EU General Data Protection Regulation online at EUR-Lex, the
			gateway to the EU -Recht, read at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679.</p>
		<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:

			Consent (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific
			purpose. An example would be the storage of the data you entered in a contact form.

		<p>Code Data Policy: (AC:1 GDPR:32) We or any third party services will not be able to access, modify or reduce any

			of your personal code - All accounts made on the server are locked with RSA 2048-bit keys.
		</p>

		Contract (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit.b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or
		pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal
		information in advance.
		Legal obligation (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process
		your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for bookkeeping. These usually contain personal
		data.
		Legitimate interests (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit.f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict
		your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in
		order to be able to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a
		legitimate interest.
		Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in public As a rule, we do not have any interest or exercise
		of public authority or the protection of vital interests. If such a legal basis should be relevant, it will be
		shown in the appropriate place.
		In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:
		In Austria this is the federal law for the protection of natural persons when processing personal data (data
		protection law), DSG for short.
		In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, or BDSG for short, applies.
		If further regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>

		<p><strong>What is web hosting?</strong></p>
		<p>When you visit websites these days, certain information - including personal data - is automatically created and
			stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible and only with
			justification. By the way, by website we mean the entirety of all websites on a domain, i.e. everything from the
			start page (homepage) to the very last subpage (like this one). By domain we mean example.de or
			musterbeispiel.com.

			When you want to view a website on one screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know some web
			browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.

			This web browser has to connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the web server. The
			operation of a web server is a complicated and time-consuming task, which is why this is usually done by
			professional providers, the providers. These offer web hosting and thus ensure reliable and error-free storage of
			website data.

			When the browser establishes a connection on your computer (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and while data is being
			transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores
			data, on the other hand, the web server must also store data for a period of time in order to ensure proper
			operation.

			Why do we process personal data?
			The purposes of the data processing are:
			Professional hosting of the website and security of operation
			to maintain operational and IT security
			Anonymous evaluation of the access behavior to improve our offer and, if necessary, to prosecute or prosecute
			claims
			Which data are processed?
			Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved,
			usually automatically saves data such as
			the complete Internet address (URL) of the website called up (e.g.
			https://www.beispielwebsite.de/beispieluntereite.html?tid=121781400)
			Browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)
			the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)
			the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g.
			https://www.beispielquellsite.de/vondabinichgekommen.html/)
			the host name and the IP address of the device from which the access is made (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)
			Date and time
			in files, the so-called web server log files</p>
		<p>As a rule, the above data is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass on this data,
			but we cannot rule out that this data will be viewed by the authorities in the event of illegal behavior.</p>
		<p><strong>Cookies Summary</strong></p>
		<p>üë• Affected: Visitors to the website
			ü§ù Purpose: depending on the respective cookie. More details can be found below or from the manufacturer of the
			software that sets the cookie.
			üìì Processed data: Depending on the cookie used. More details can be found below or from the manufacturer of the
			software that sets the cookie.
			üìÖ Storage duration: depending on the respective cookie, can vary from hours to years

			What are cookies?
			Our website uses HTTP cookies to save user-specific data.
			In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following
			data protection declaration.
			Whenever you surf the Internet, you are using a browser. Well-known browsers are, for example, Chrome, Safari,
			Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites save small text files in your browser. These files
			are called cookies.
			One thing cannot be dismissed out of hand: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use
			cookies. To be more precise, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other areas of
			application. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are
			automatically placed in the cookie folder, which is the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a
			value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.
			Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site
			again, your browser sends the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows
			who you are and offers you the settings that you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, in
			others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
